          ASL_Learning, short for American Sign Language Learning 
          is web app dedicated to
           teaching ASL to users in simple and 
          easy to use way. Through the use of Flashcards and a hands on
          approach, users can learn day by day ASL alphabet letters. 
          Our goal with ASL_Learning is to make the process of learning ASL 
          quick and easy. Currently we count with a flash card system of learning
          but we plan to implement other features like quizes and ASL hand reading
          technology.</p>
